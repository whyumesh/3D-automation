the attached 3 files are used to create zbm summary report, their consolidated file and send email to the 
respective zbm and cc abm. 
it correctly creates zbm summary and consolidated file but
it doesn't uses the already created zbm summary file 
to send on mail and neither the consolidated file is attached.
it correctly add's zbm email in To: and the zbm's abm in the Cc:
but the consolidated file is not attached and the already created zbm summary report is not used to send in html format.
the zbm summary report is in "ZBM Reports" file and consolidated
files are in "consolidated files" folder.

please make sure everything works perfectly accurate as this will be used 
in real-world prod
